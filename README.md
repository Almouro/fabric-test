# Fabric test

Design heavily inspired by [this project](https://github.com/MatheusPires99/pokedex)

Quick POC to compare performance with and without Fabric.

On Android disable Fabric by setting `newArchEnabled=false` in `android/gradle.properties`

Weirdly, performance is worse with Fabric, the FlatList becomes non scrollable (which is symptomatic of the JS thread being clogged)... What did I miss? ðŸ¤”

Worth mentioning the thread with the highest CPU usage isn't even the JS thread, it's a thread called "pool-5-thread-1", probably used by Fabric.
